# Virtual Influence - E-Newsletter

Using React and Tailwind CSS, I combined my passion for Front-end Development and Public Speaking to create a one-of-a-kind responsive website newsletter for Daffodils Toastmasters Club, Bangalore, India.
 
Based on the theme **Virtual Influence - Building Relationships through Tech**, the website is a testimonial to the legacy of my club. It also contains an exclusive interview section with the First Runner-Up in the 2020 World Championship of Public Speaking, **TM Linda-Marie Miller**.

This challenging project could not have been done without the support of my fellow Toastmasters, who encouraged me in this unique approach of creating a newsletter.
