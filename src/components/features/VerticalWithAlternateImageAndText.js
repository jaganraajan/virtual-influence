        "Business partners, leaders, trusted advisors,  sales people, collaborators, experts â€“ every one of us needs influencing skills.  We want people to buy into our ideas, follow our lead and trust what we say.\n\nBut the pandemic has truly changed how we interact in the world. We rely on technology more than ever and most of our interaction with others is virtual. The question now is how do you build these relationships virtually and build the trust?\n\nAt the start of my term as the Vice President of Public Relations, I found it hard to develop virtual relationship with my President and my associates. As I grew and learnt how to navigate this new world, I gained valuable experiences which showed me the optimal way to build stronger relationships.\n\nThis website is our way of influencing you by providing a user-friendly way of reading our newsletter. We hope you enjoy reading this as much as we enjoyed creating this website.  ",

        "Toastmasters, a non-profit organization is one of the best examples to see the difference between power and influence. It shines because the platform has influence as a diamond made of constructive critisism, rightly valued experience of seasoned Toastmasters, and encouraging environment. Lately, it has been constrained to virtual connections. Although it started slow at the beginning of the pandemic, it has grown exponentially over the last one a half year. A lot of us has adapted quickly to this setting and we are able to virtually influence each other. A good example of that is the building of relationships over the virtual platform in my home club, or rather a family, Daffodils Toastmasters Club!",
